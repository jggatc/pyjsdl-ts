Pyjsdl - Python-to-JavaScript Multimedia Framework

Pyjsdl module is modelled on Pygame/SDL commands that wraps JavaScript functionality including HTML5 canvas. The module permits scripts coded in Python/Pygame to compile to JavaScript using the Transcrypt compiler (https://www.transcrypt.org/), allowing deployment of JavaScript applications without extensive editing of the script. The current version of the module supports a subset of Pygame functionality. Information concerning use of the Pyjsdl module is included in guide.txt.
